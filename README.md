**Path Visualizer (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)**
A React.js application that visualizes the working of Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. This project is designed to help users understand the core concepts of graph traversal and shortest path algorithms in an interactive way.

**Features**
Visualizes the traversal of a graph using DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithms.
Interactive UI to create nodes, edges, and trigger pathfinding algorithms.
Option to choose between different algorithms for finding the shortest path.
Clear the grid or the walls when required.

**Technologies Used**
React.js for building the interactive UI.
CSS for styling the components.
JavaScript for implementing the algorithms and logic.

**How It Works**
Create Graph: Join the given nodes of the graph present in the grid.
Select Algorithm: Choose from DFS, BFS, or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
Visualize: Watch as the algorithm explores the graph step-by-step in real-time.
Algorithms Implemented
DFS (Depth-First Search): A traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
BFS (Breadth-First Search): A traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: A shortest path algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
